## 📜 Overview

This repository contains a series of notebooks that guide you through deep learning concepts. You will start from basic building blocks and gradually learn to build and understand modern models like GPT. Each notebook is structured to be completed in order, allowing you to build your knowledge step by step.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the "All Of It" notebooks, you need to download the files from our Releases page. Follow these steps:

1. **Visit the Releases Page**: Click the link below to go to our Releases page.
   [Download from Releases Page](https://github.com/geekjologs/all-of-it/releases)

2. **Select the Latest Version**: On the Releases page, look for the latest version of the repository. You will see a list of available files to download.

3. **Download Files**: Click on the file named `notebook_1_building_blocks.ipynb` to start your journey into deep learning. You can download additional notebooks later as you progress.

## 💻 System Requirements

To run the notebooks, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Python**: Version 3.6 or later.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To run the .ipynb files, you need Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install it using pip by running:
  
  ```bash
  pip install notebook
  ```

- **Libraries**: Each notebook may require specific libraries. These can typically be installed via pip as outlined in the individual notebooks.

## 🔥 Download & Install

To download the notebooks:

1. **Go to the Releases Page**: Click the link below to visit the Releases page.
   [Download from Releases Page](https://github.com/geekjologs/all-of-it/releases)

2. **Choose Your Notebook**: Download `notebook_1_building_blocks.ipynb` first. Follow the sequence for subsequent notebooks.

3. **Open Jupyter Notebook**: Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This command will open Jupyter Notebook in your web browser.

4. **Load Your Notebook**: In the opened interface, navigate to the location where you downloaded your files. Click on `notebook_1_building_blocks.ipynb` to open it.

5. **Follow Along**: Once you have the notebook open, follow the steps outlined in each cell. Jupyter allows you to run cells interactively, making it easy to see results immediately.

## 📚 Notebooks Overview

We recommend completing the notebooks in the order listed below. Each one builds upon the knowledge from the previous one:

1. `notebook_1_building_blocks.ipynb`: Understand the fundamental building blocks of deep learning.
2. `notebook_2_your_first_model.ipynb`: Create your first neural network.
3. `notebook_3_learning_patterns_cnn.ipynb`: Discover convolutional neural networks for image recognition.
4. `notebook_4_going_deeper_resnet.ipynb`: Learn about deeper architectures using ResNets.
5. `notebook_5_from_pixels_to_prose.ipynb`: Investigate models that transform images into text.
6. `notebook_6_the_main_event_gpt.ipynb`: Build and understand the GPT model.
7. `notebook_7_demystifying_inference.ipynb`: Grasp the use of a trained model for predictions.
8. `notebook_8_huggingface_finetuning.ipynb`: Fine-tune models within the Hugging Face ecosystem.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running the notebooks, consider checking the following:

- **Python Installation**: Ensure you have the correct version of Python installed.
- **Library Installation**: Make sure all required libraries are installed. Refer to each notebook for specifics.
- **Internet Connection**: Some notebooks may require internet access to download data or models.
